The drag and drop functionality project allows users to interactively move items from one container to another by simply dragging and dropping them. The project features two containers, each displaying a set of items. Users can click and drag an item from the first container and drop it into the second container. Upon successful shifting, a message is displayed confirming the successful action. Additionally, a reset button is provided to restore the original arrangement. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an intuitive and engaging user experience, enabling seamless item manipulation through the drag and drop interaction paradigm.
